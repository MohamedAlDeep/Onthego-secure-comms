# OnTheGo
This is End to End encrpytion web app that enables anyone to create disposable acounts on their client side, and create PGP encryption keys and use them to encrypt and decrypt messages all on your browser, no server intervention.

This project utilizes the `openpgp` node library and uses `RSA` encryption algorithm.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
